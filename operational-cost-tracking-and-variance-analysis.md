# Operational Cost Tracking & Variance Analysis

## Context
In operational environments, costs are often incurred across multiple activities without a clear structure for monitoring variances. Without systematic tracking, management lacks early visibility into overspending and inefficiencies.

## Problem
Operational costs were monitored informally, limiting the ability to compare actual spending against expectations and identify variance drivers in a timely manner.

## Financial Approach
I supported the introduction of structured cost tracking and variance analysis by:
- Defining cost categories aligned with operational activities
- Establishing simple budget baselines for recurring costs
- Tracking actual spending against expected levels
- Identifying key variance drivers and cost anomalies

## Analysis & Reporting
- Conducted periodic budget vs. actual reviews
- Analyzed cost variances by category and activity
- Highlighted unfavorable variances requiring corrective action
- Prepared concise variance summaries for management discussion

## Tools Used
- Excel for cost tracking and variance analysis
- Structured templates for budget vs. actual comparisons
- Basic financial performance indicators

## Results & Impact
- Improved visibility into operational cost behavior
- Enabled earlier identification of cost overruns
- Supported cost control initiatives contributing to **estimated 5–10% cost stabilisation**
- Strengthened financial discipline across operational activities

## Key Learnings
- Regular variance analysis improves financial control even in low-data environments
- Clear cost categorisation is essential for meaningful financial insights
- Early visibility enables proactive cost management
