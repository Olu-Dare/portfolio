# Finance & Business Performance Projects

## Overview
This section highlights my experience in financial performance analysis, cost optimisation, budget monitoring, and financial decision support across operational, non-profit, and business environments.

My work focuses on strengthening cost discipline, improving financial visibility, and supporting better decision-making through structured, conservative financial analysis.

- Analyzed cost drivers and spending patterns to identify optimisation opportunities
