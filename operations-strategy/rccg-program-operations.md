# RCCG – Program Operations & Cost Optimisation

## Context
The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) is a large, international non-profit organization delivering recurring education and community programs across multiple locations. These programs depend on coordinated scheduling, volunteer facilitators, and the sourcing and distribution of educational materials.

## Problem
As programs expanded across local, national, and regional levels, operational challenges emerged. Program coordination, material sourcing, and logistics were largely decentralized, resulting in inconsistent processes, limited cost visibility, and avoidable inefficiencies.

## Role & Responsibilities
I served in a program and regional operations leadership role, supporting initiatives at local, national, and regional levels. My responsibilities included:
- Coordinating program delivery across multiple locations
- Leading and mentoring facilitators and teachers
- Overseeing the sourcing and distribution of educational materials
- Supporting planning, scheduling, and basic operational reporting

## Actions Taken
To improve operational efficiency and cost control, I implemented the following:
- Introduced basic procurement discipline, including supplier comparison and bulk sourcing where feasible
- Standardized logistics and material distribution processes across multiple locations
- Improved coordination between facilitators, teachers, and regional leadership
- Supported structured planning and reporting for recurring programs

## Tools & Methods
- Process standardization
- Basic procurement analysis and supplier comparison
- Multi-location coordination frameworks
- Operational planning and reporting tools

## Results & Impact
- Supported program execution involving **20–40 facilitators and coordinators**
- Improved operational consistency across local, national, and regional levels
- Contributed to an **estimated 10–15% reduction in material and logistics costs**
- Increased visibility and coordination across program operations

## Key Learnings
- Even simple cost-awareness measures can deliver meaningful savings in non-profit environments
- Standardized processes significantly improve execution quality at scale
- Clear coordination structures are essential for effective multi-location program delivery
