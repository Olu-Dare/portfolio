# Hiring Scenarios & Runway Sensitivity Analysis (MediGene)

## Context
As part of a data analytics engagement at 10Alytics, I worked on an operational and financial analysis for MediGene, a biopharmaceutical company evaluating different hiring strategies while managing cash runway constraints.

The objective was to assess how alternative hiring scenarios would impact monthly burn rate, total costs, and runway duration under a fixed funding assumption.

## Problem
MediGene faced a trade-off between accelerating hiring to support R&D and clinical activities versus preserving financial runway. Decision-makers needed a clear, data-driven view of how different hiring strategies would affect sustainability and funding needs.

## Data & Assumptions
- Total funding assumed: **€30M**
- Fixed monthly costs: approximately **€600k**
- Variable costs driven primarily by salaries
- Three hiring scenarios:
  - **Conservative**
  - **Baseline**
  - **Aggressive**

## Analytical Approach
I supported the analysis by:
- Consolidating hiring and cost assumptions across departments
- Modelling total all-in costs per scenario
- Calculating average monthly hiring costs and total monthly burn
- Estimating runway (in months) under each scenario
- Performing sensitivity analysis on key cost drivers (notably R&D spend)

## Scenario & Sensitivity Analysis
Key insights included:
- Baseline scenario runway of approximately **35 months**
- Conservative scenario extending runway to approximately **33 months**
- Aggressive scenario reducing runway to approximately **24 months**
- A **20% reduction in R&D spend** extended runway across all scenarios, with the largest relative impact under the aggressive plan

## Tools Used
- Excel for scenario modelling, cost aggregation, and sensitivity analysis
- PowerPoint for synthesizing results and presenting insights
- Structured KPI definitions (burn rate, runway, cost per hire)

## Results & Impact
- Provided leadership with a clear comparison of hiring strategies and financial impact
- Quantified trade-offs between speed of execution and financial sustainability
- Identified R&D spend as the primary cost lever affecting runway
- Supported strategic recommendations, including phased hiring and hybrid scenario approaches

## Key Learnings
- Scenario analysis is critical for operational decision-making under uncertainty
- Sensitivity analysis helps identify the most impactful cost levers
- Clear data visualisation improves alignment between operational and financial stakeholders
