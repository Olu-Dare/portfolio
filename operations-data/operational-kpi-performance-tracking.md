# Operational KPI Framework & Performance Tracking

## Context
Operational teams often execute multiple activities across locations or functions without a clear, unified view of performance. Decision-making becomes reactive when KPIs are undefined or inconsistently tracked.

## Problem
The absence of a structured KPI framework limited visibility into operational efficiency, delivery timelines, and resource utilization. Reporting was fragmented, making it difficult to identify bottlenecks or track performance trends over time.

## KPI Framework Design
To address this, I designed a simple but scalable KPI framework aligned with operational objectives, focusing on:
- Delivery timeliness
- Resource utilization
- Cost efficiency
- Output quality and consistency

KPIs were defined with clear ownership, measurement frequency, and thresholds to support actionable insights.

## Data & Reporting Approach
- Consolidated operational data from spreadsheets and source systems
- Standardized data definitions to ensure consistency
- Designed structured reporting views to track trends and variances
- Enabled periodic performance reviews using data-driven insights

## Tools Used
- Excel for data consolidation and validation
- Power BI for dashboarding and visualization
- Basic SQL queries for data extraction (where applicable)

## Outcomes & Insights
- Improved visibility into operational performance across teams
- Enabled faster identification of bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Supported more informed, data-driven operational decisions
- Established a repeatable reporting structure for ongoing performance tracking

## Key Learnings
- Well-defined KPIs are critical for translating operational activity into measurable outcomes
- Consistent data definitions significantly improve reporting reliability
- Simple dashboards, when aligned to decision-making needs, can drive meaningful operational improvements
